Lately I have been doing mostly full stack things with TS, Node, Express, Vue/React, which is probably my the strongest stack. I have done some backend with Spring. Also C# .NET back end is interesting, but I have not studied it yet.

I don't have nothing against desktop or mobile developing, I just have not done them lately.

Shortly skillset:

>**Top**:<br>TS/JS, React, Vue, Node, Express



>**I have done, not top tier**:<br>Java, Android, Spring, C++, TypeORM


>**Interested to expand skillset:**<br>C#


>**Other skills:**<br>Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Git, npm, OpenLayers, TypeORM
